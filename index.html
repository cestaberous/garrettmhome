            <h4>Google Login (Half-)Implemented</h4>
            <p>
                If you have looked at the copyright menu, you may have noticed that I have added a Google sign in button.
                At the moment, the only function is to sign in and get the Name of the logged in user. I am continuing to implement
                this further. More info, visit the <a href="/projects/web/gauth">Project Page</a>.

            <h4>Collatz Java Program Released</h4>
            <p>
                I posted the first (stable) version of my simple Java application. This CLI application takes a number from arguments
                and runs the Collatz Conjecture on it until it resolves to 1, counting the iterations, and reports the iterations and the
                number of iterations until a number of double format (<a href="/resources/javavars.html">Java Variable Description Here</a>)
                resolves to 1. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture"><b>What is the Collatz Conjecture?</b></a>

            <p>
                I have released the first version of my JSURL Library.<br/><br/>
                This library for JavaScript will, upon being loaded, scan the URL for variables in the following format: <br/><br/>
