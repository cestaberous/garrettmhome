            <h2>Garrett Mills</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Garrett, in case you hadn't picked that up, and I am best described as a technology enthusiast. I work on
                web design, coding, Raspberry Pi, Minecraft Modding, network structure, robotics, and just awesome computers and hardware in general.
                </p> 
            <p>I have in the past taught the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics camp at the Anderson County Extention office, and have worked in many
                competitions and courses for the robot platform myself. Aside from that, I have recently gotten in to Raspberry Pi robotics and electronics,
                and computer hardware. </p>
            <p>As for the software side, this is really where my passion for computers lies. I love to code and manipulate
                computers to achieve a goal. I am fluent in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python, Java, and Bash
                (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">the master of Linux</a>). I love open-source and have been working
                with various Linux distrobutions and flavours for 5 years now. If you are curious about any of my current projects, feel free
                to visit my <a href="http://github.com/cestaberous">GitHub Page.</a></p>
            <p>Another thing I have an interest in is network structure, and this may strike people as strange, but I find it fascinating to tinker
                play with computers and servers and routers to get them to talk to eachother.</p>
